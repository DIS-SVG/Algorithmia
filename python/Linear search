1.Start from the leftmost element of given arr[] and one by one compare element x with each element of arr[]

2.If x matches with any of the element, return the index value.

3.If x doesnâ€™t  with any of elements in arr[] , return -1 or element not found.

def linearsearch(arr, x):
   for i in range(len(arr)):
      if arr[i] == x:
         return i
   return -1
arr = ['t','u','t','o','r','i','a','l']
x = 'a'
print("element found at index "+str(linearsearch(arr,x)))
